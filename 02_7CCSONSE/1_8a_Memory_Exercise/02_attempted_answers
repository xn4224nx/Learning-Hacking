The stack before calling foo():

%ebp            (the stack frame pointer for main)
%ecx            (save convention)
                (ret - empty)
%p              (address returned by malloc)
0x41            (y)
Line 19 <main>  (SRET)

The stack at the execution of foo (same as above but including the mem below)

%ebp            (the stack frame pointer for foo)
0x2a            (c = 42)
0xa             (b = 10)
0x42            (a = ++*p)
String Address

The value of %eax after main resumes and foo terminates:

0x42
