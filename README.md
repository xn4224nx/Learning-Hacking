# Learning-Hacking

Documents created when learning hacking.

## Resources Used

A collection of the completed exercises script files created when learning hacking. The resources used in learning are a follows:

1. [Hacking: The Art of Exploitation](https://nostarch.com/hacking2.htm) - Hacking is the art of creative problem solving, whether that means finding an unconventional solution to a difficult problem or exploiting holes in sloppy programming. Many people call themselves hackers, but few have the strong technical foundation needed to really push the envelope.

2. [Linux Basics for Hackers](https://nostarch.com/linuxbasicsforhackers) - This practical, tutorial-style book uses the Kali Linux distribution to teach Linux basics with a focus on how hackers would use them. Topics include Linux command line basics, filesystems, networking, BASH basics, package management, logging, and the Linux kernel and drivers.

3. [Black Hat Python](https://nostarch.com/black-hat-python2E) - Fully-updated for Python 3, the second edition of this worldwide bestseller (over 100,000 copies sold) explores the stealthier side of programming and brings you all new strategies for your hacking projects.

4. [Black Hat Bash](https://nostarch.com/black-hat-bash) - Master the art of offensive bash scripting. This highly practical hands-on guide covers chaining commands together, automating tasks, crafting living-off-the-land attacks, and more! 

## Future Resources

Some viable books to use in future learning:

1. [Crypto101](https://www.crypto101.io/) - Crypto 101 is an introductory course on cryptography, freely available for programmers of all ages and skill levels.

2. [Understanding Cryptography](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-69007-9) - After introducing basic cryptography concepts, this seminal textbook covers nearly all symmetric, asymmetric, and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms currently in use in applications—ranging from cloud computing and smart phones all the way to industrial systems, block chains, and cryptocurrencies.

3. [the cryptopals crypto challenges](https://www.cryptopals.com/) - A collection of exercises that demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto. 

4. [Cryptography Engineering: Design Principles and Practical Applications](https://www.schneier.com/books/cryptography-engineering) - The ultimate guide to cryptography, updated from an author team of the world's top cryptography experts. Cryptography is vital to keeping information safe, in an era when the formula to do so becomes more and more challenging. Written by a team of world-renowned cryptography experts, this essential guide is the definitive introduction to all major areas of cryptography: message security, key negotiation, and key management.

5. [A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography](https://toc.cryptobook.us/) - The book covers many constructions for different tasks in cryptography. For each task we define a precise security goal that we aim to achieve and then present constructions that achieve the required goal. To analyze the constructions, we develop a unified framework for doing cryptographic proofs. A reader who masters this framework will be capable of applying it to new constructions that may not be covered in the book.

6. [Real-World Cryptography](https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-cryptography) - An all-practical guide to the cryptography behind common tools and protocols that will help you make excellent security choices for your systems and applications.

7. [Applied Cryptography](https://www.schneier.com/books/applied-cryptography/) - From the world's most renowned security technologist, Bruce Schneier, this 20th Anniversary Edition is the most definitive reference on cryptography ever published and is the seminal work on cryptography.

8. [Full Stack Python Security](https://www.manning.com/books/full-stack-python-security) - Full Stack Python Security teaches you everything you’ll need to build secure Python web applications. 

9. [Secret Key Cryptography]() - Explore the fascinating and rich world of Secret Key cryptography! This book provides practical methods for encrypting messages, an interesting and entertaining historical perspective, and an incredible collection of ciphers and codes—including 30 unbreakable methods.
